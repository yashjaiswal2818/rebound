# Rebound Evaluation Matrix & Reliability Results

**Last Run:** 2026-09-13 17:38:54 UTC  
**Test Suite:** 30 Chaos & Disruption Scenarios ($\\tau$-bench End-State Verification)  
**Pass Rate:** **30/30 (100.0%)**  

> **Reliability Directive:** Every scenario asserts the terminal state of the database, API fakes,

## Key Invariants Empirically Proven

1. **Idempotency (S10):** Duplicate webhooks never trigger a second ticket order.
2. **Irreversible Action Order (S20, S21):** Old tickets are only cancelled *after* the new order is verified via Duffel GET. Verification mismatches abort the cancellation.
3. **Hold-Order Pattern (S02, S13):** Inventory is held before SMS approval, preventing 15-minute offer expiry.
4. **API Fault Tolerance (S11, S27, S29):** Network 500s trigger exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s). Non-critical calendar and email outages degrade gracefully.
5. **Spend Ceilings & Guardrails (S05, S15):** Policy limits exist in deterministic Python assertions; the model cannot book out-of-policy flights.
